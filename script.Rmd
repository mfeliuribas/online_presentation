3. Context
Background literature (briefly):
  * ML settings: gender and social class as relevant variables of language 
  change. Is this the same in immigrant BL settings? 
  * This study examines the role of social class and gender in an ongoing 
  change (change in progress) in NYC Spanish -> the variable use of subject
  pronouns.
  * Differences of pronoun rates between Spanish and English: Spanish as a pro-
  drop language vs English as a non-pro-drop language.
  * Results: the change occurs most rapidly among the more affluent Latino 
  communities and among women (first-generation). THEY REPORT MORE THINGS IN 
  THE INTRODUCTION. 
  I SHOULD CHECK. 
  * Novelty of the study: they separate participants by national origin (p. 
  430).
  * Explanations by internal factors (e.g., ceiling effect) and external factors
  (e.g., longer in NYC, higher levels of English, more affluent, sex/gender) 
  (p. 431).
  * Important stuff: opposite pattern in ML settings as of social class of the 
  leaders of change + women as the leaders of change as in ML settings.
  * Previous research: 
     * On ML settings: strong tendency for language change to be led by working 
     or lower middle class people and by women. 
     * On BL settings: scarce research? (+ preguntar a Austin, p. 432) + some
     previous research supports the role of social class and gender in changes
     taking place in BL contexts (Orozco, 2007, 2009a, 2009b; Alfaraz, 2010; Van
     Ness, 1995).
     * Foundation of the present study: Otheguy & Zentella (2012). They found
     some evidence for the impact of social class and gender on changes in 
     pronominal use in Spanish in NYC. Participants divided into 2 groups: 
     Caribbean and Mainland Latin America. No effects of class on pronoun rates 
     among Caribbeans, but did among Mainlanders (working class vs middle 
     class). Effects of gender on pronoun rates among Mainlanders, not among 
     Caribbeans. 
     -> Este estudio quiere saber si el origen nacional influye en este cambio.

Research Questions:
Not explicit. Possible RQ:
  1. PENSAR CÓMO FORMULAR ESTA PREGUNTA - 
  "While the division of the Otheguy-Zentella corpus into two regions has 
  revealed important observations regarding change in NYC, such a whole-sample
  approach leaves us with questions regardind people of various national 
  origins. The current study more precisely pinpoints the Latinos who undergo
  greater and lesser amounts of change in New York." (p. 433)
      e.g. How does national origin impact the variable use of subject pronouns
      in NYC Spanish?
      e.g. Is there any difference in the variable use of subject pronouns in
      NYC Spanish based on demographic location/national origin?
      e.g. How different is the variable use of subject pronouns in NYC Spanish
      based on national origin?
  2. Does social class impact the variable use of subject pronouns in NYC 
  Spanish toward more Anglicized patterns of subject pronoun use?
  3. Does gender impact the variable use of subject pronouns in NYC 
  Spanish toward more Anglicized patterns of subject pronoun use?

Methodology
Participants: n = 140 - Newcomers vs New Yorkers
  * Newcomers - n = 39 (arrived at age 17 or older, no more than 5 years in 
  NYC)
  * New Yorkers - n = 101 (born in NYC OR arrived at age 16 before OR arrived 
  at age 17 or older but more than 5 years in NYC).
  _# ¿Esta diferencia (n) podría haber impactado los resultados de algún modo?_
  _# Argumentan esta diferencia diciendo que en cada país hay una cantidad_
  _parecida o igual si se miran dentro del gran grupo (newcomers vs NYs)._ 
  _# Is this argument enough?_
Data: interviews from the Otheguy-Zentella corpus - tokens of all tensed verbs
that occur with a subject pronoun but could have occurred without one, or that
are found without a pronoun but could have been found with one, and that make
animate references. 
-> They examine the tensed verbs in contexts where pronoun usage is variable.
